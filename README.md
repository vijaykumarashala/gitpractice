You have just taken your first step toward getting involved. Before you get started, we ask that you please observe the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. It’s not very long and it will help you get started.

Teams

The Teams page contains a listing of the various Community Teams, their responsibilities, links to their Wiki Home Pages and leaders, communication tools, and a quick reference to let you know whether and when they hold meetings.

Most Teams’ Wiki Home Pages provide information about who they are, what they do, when their meetings are, and how to contact them. Using these pages, teammates are able to communicate and coordinate projects.
